<p>
This book teaches model-based analysis and model-based testing: new
ways to write and analyze software specifications and designs, generate test
cases, and check the results of test runs.  The methods increase the
automation in each of these activities, so they can be more timely,
more thorough, and (we expect) more effective.  

<p>
The book works through several realistic case
studies in depth and detail, using a toolkit
<!-- <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NModel">toolkit</a> -->
built on the C# language
and the .NET framework.  The systems which are tested and analyzed do
not have to use C# or .NET.  The book discusses principles that are
independent of this particular language and framework.

<p>
This book is intended for professional software developers including
testers, and for university students.  It is suitable for courses on
software engineering, testing, specification, or applications of
formal methods.  The style is accessible and the
emphasis is practical, yet there is enough information to make
this book a useful introduction to the underlying theory.

The book uses the <a href="https://jon-jacky.github.io/NModel/">NModel</a>
analysis and testing framework.  Some sample models and other code
from the book are included in the NModel software release.
